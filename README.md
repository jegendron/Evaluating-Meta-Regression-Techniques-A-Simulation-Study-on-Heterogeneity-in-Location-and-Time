## <em>Each R file does the following:</em>
1. Generates data depending on which case it is (1-12) for either 1, 3 or 5 covariates (depending on the file)
2. Runs the data through all ten meta-regression methodology specifications in a Monte Carlo simulation
3. Generates graphs to illustrate the results for all ten methodology specifications side by side.
4. Calculates power, and then exports all data from the simulation (including the data itself, parameters, standard errors, etc.)


<em>Above is done to test which meta-regression methodology specification performs optimally in the face of joint heterogeneity in the location and time that each study was conducted in.</em>
>NOTE: The paper this code refers to will be available on arXiv very soon.
