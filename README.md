## <em>Each R file does the following:</em>
1. Generates data depending on which case it is (1-12)
2. Runs the data through all ten meta-regression methodology specifications in a Monte Carlo simulation
3. Generates graphs to illustrate the results for all ten methodology specifications side by side.
4. Calculates power, and then exports all data from the simulation (including the data itself, parameters, standard errors, etc.)
